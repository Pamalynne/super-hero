            <h2>If Disney princesses were styled by modern designers</h2>
            <p>This illustrated shoe collection was designed with the idea: What if modern fashion designers reimagined iconic characters through footwear? Each shoe blends bold creativity with character-driven cues—drawing from color palettes, textures, and silhouettes that reflect distinct personalities and emotional traits. Rather than relying on literal references, the designs interpret signature styles through subtle details: unexpected material pairings, whimsical accents, and elegant structure. Some shoes lean into soft romance, others channel strength or rebellion, but all reflect a balance of modern fashion trends with storytelling spirit. The result is a cohesive yet diverse collection that feels wearable, expressive, and distinctly personal—like each design could walk straight off a runway and into a fairytale.See if you can guess which shoe belongs to which princess.</p>
