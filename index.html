            <p>This website is a creative project made for a beginner coding course. It explores what shoes might look like if they were designed for Disney princesses by modern fashion designers. Each princess has her own page with a short bio, fun facts, personality traits, and more. You can also visit the Shoe Gallery, where each custom shoe design links back to the princess it was inspired by. This project helped me learn how to build web pages, add images, and link everything together. I hope you enjoy browsing!</p>
